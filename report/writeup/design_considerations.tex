\section{Approach to Software Design}
\label{sec:design_considerations}

Our software development has been heavily inspired by the Agile methodology\todo{Add a ref to agilemanifesto.org}. 
The key principles of this methodology have been neatly summarised in a blog post by Kelly Waters\footnote{Available at \url{http://www.allaboutagile.com/what-is-agile-10-key-principles/}}:

\blockquote{
    [The] characteristics that are common to all agile methods, and the things that I think make agile fundamentally different to a more traditional waterfall approach to software development [..] are:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Active user involvement is imperative 
        \item The team must be empowered to make decisions 
        \item Requirements evolve but the timescale is fixed 
        \item Capture requirements at a high level; lightweight \& visual 
        \item Develop small, incremental releases and iterate 
        \item Focus on frequent delivery of products 
        \item Complete each feature before moving on to the next 
        \item Apply the 80/20 rule 
        \item Testing is integrated throughout the project lifecycle â€“ test early and often 
        \item A collaborative \& cooperative approach between all stakeholders is essential 
    \end{enumerate}
