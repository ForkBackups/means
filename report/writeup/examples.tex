\section{Example of Usage} \label{examples}
In this section, we desmonstrate a simple usage of \means. 
A collection of detailed tutorials is available in Appendix~\ref{tutorials}.

A common example if the tummor suppresior \pft system. 
Whist relatively uncomplicated, it shows an shows an interesting oscilatory behaviour and has been exhaustively studied \cite{geva-zatorsky_oscillations_2006, batchelor_ups_2009}.
The model can be formulated as a list of species, a list of reaction between species, and a stoichiometry matrix.
For this system, we will consider the species $$, $$, $$
