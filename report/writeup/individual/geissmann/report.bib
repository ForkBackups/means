The mathematical modeling of their interaction through multivariate dynamical models requires the deveopment of effective statistical methods to calibrate such models against available data. Given the prevalence of stochasticity and noise in biochemical systems inference for stochastic models is of special interest. In this paper we present a simple and computationally efficient algorithm for the estimation of biochemical kinetic parameters from gene reporter data.

	doi = {10.1186/1752-0509-4-92},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Quantitative models of biochemical and cellular systems are used to answer a variety of questions in the biological sciences. The number of published quantitative models is growing steadily thanks to increasing interest in the use of models as well as the development of improved software systems and the availability of better, cheaper computer hardware. To maximise the benefits of this growing body of models, the field needs centralised model repositories that will encourage, facilitate and promote model dissemination and reuse. Ideally, the models stored in these repositories should be extensively tested and encoded in community-supported and standardised formats. In addition, the models and their components should be cross-referenced with other resources in order to allow their unambiguous identification.
{DESCRIPTION:} {BioModels} Database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/ is aimed at addressing exactly these needs. It is a freely-accessible online resource for storing, viewing, retrieving, and analysing published, peer-reviewed quantitative models of biochemical and cellular systems. The structure and behaviour of each simulation model distributed by {BioModels} Database are thoroughly checked; in addition, model elements are annotated with terms from controlled vocabularies as well as linked to relevant data resources. Models can be examined online or downloaded in various formats. Reaction network diagrams generated from the models are also available in several formats. {BioModels} Database also provides features such as online simulation and the extraction of components from large scale models into smaller submodels. Finally, the system provides a range of web services that external software systems can use to access up-to-date data from the database.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {BioModels} Database has become a recognised reference resource for systems biology. It is being used by the community in a variety of ways; for example, it is used to benchmark different simulation systems, and to study the clustering of models based upon their annotations. Model deposition to the database today is advised by several publishers of scientific journals. The models in {BioModels} Database are freely distributed and reusable; the underlying software infrastructure is also available from {SourceForge} https://sourceforge.net/projects/biomodels/ under the {GNU} General Public License.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics and variability of protein circuitry requires accurate measurements in living cells as well as theoretical models. To address this, we employed one of the best-studied protein circuits in human cells, the negative feedback loop between the tumor suppressor p53 and the oncogene Mdm2. We measured the dynamics of fluorescently tagged p53 and Mdm2 over several days in individual living cells. We found that isogenic cells in the same environment behaved in highly variable ways following {DNA-damaging} gamma irradiation: some cells showed undamped oscillations for at least 3 days (more than 10 peaks). The amplitude of the oscillations was much more variable than the period. Sister cells continued to oscillate in a correlated way after cell division, but lost correlation after about 11 h on average. Other cells showed low-frequency fluctuations that did not resemble oscillations. We also analyzed different families of mathematical models of the system, including a novel checkpoint mechanism. The models point to the possible source of the variability in the oscillations: low-frequency noise in protein production rates, rather than noise in other parameters such as degradation rates. This study provides a view of the extensive variability of the behavior of a protein circuit in living human cells, both from cell to cell and in the same cell over time.},

	abstract = {An exact method is presented for numerically calculating, within the framework of the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, the time evolution of any spatially homogeneous mixture of molecular species which interreact through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction channels. The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For “ordinary” chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called “the reaction probability density function.” The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications.},

the use of rejection sampling for latent trajectories with fixed initial

show how graphical processing units can be efficiently utilized for
parameter estimation in systems that hitherto were inestimable. For more
complex systems, we show the efficiency gain over traditional {CPU}

	abstract = {During the last three decades, a vast variety of methods to numerically solve ordinary differential equations ({ODEs)} and differential algebraic equations ({DAEs)} has been developed and investigated. Few of them met industrial standards and even less are available within industrial multibody simulation software. Multibody Systems ({MBS)} offer a challenging class [5] of applications for these methods, since the resulting system equations are in the unconstrained case {ODEs} which are often stiff or highly oscillatory. In the constrained case the equations are {DAEs} of index-3 or less. Friction and impact in the {MBS} model introduce discontinuities into these equations while coupling to discrete controllers and hardware-in-the-loop components
couple these equations to additional time discrete descriptions. Many of the developed numerical methods have promising qualities for these types of problems, but rarely got the chance to be tested on large scale problems. One reason is the closed software concept of most of the leading multibody system simulation tools or interface concepts with a high threshold to overcome. Thus, these ideas never left the academic environment with their perhaps complex but dimensionally low scale test problems. In this paper we will present a workbench, {ASSIMULO}, which allows easy and direct incorporation of new methods for solving {ODEs} or {DAEs} written in {FORTRAN}, C, Python or even {MATLAB} and which indirectly interfaces to multibody programs such as Dymola and Simpack, via a standardized interface, the functional mock-up interface. The paper is concluded with industrial relevant examples evaluated using industrial and academic solvers.},

As a result they are often more efficient than the dedicated explicit ones, particularly when approximately two or more figures of accuracy are required. In most test cases, sparse {RODAs}, a Rosenbrock solver, came out as most competitive in the 1\% error region. Of the dedicated explicit solvers, {TWOSTEP} came out as best. When less than 1\% accuracy is aimed at, this solver performs very efficiently for tropospheric gas-phase problems. However, like all other dedicated explicit solvers, it cannot efficiently deal with gas-liquid phase chemistry. The results presented may constitute a guide for atmospheric modelers to select a suitable integrator based on the type and dimension of their chemical mechanism and on the desired level of accuracy. Furthermore, we would like to consider this paper an open invitation for other groups to add new representative test problems to those described here and to benchmark their numerical algorithms in our standard computational environment.},

The authors describe here the derivation and application of what they term the mass fluctuation kinetics ({MFK)}, a set of deterministic equations to track the means, variances, and covariances of the concentrations of the chemical species in the system. These equations are obtained by approximating the dynamics of the first and second moments of the chemical master equation. Apart from needing knowledge of the system volume, the {MFK} description requires only the same information used to specify the {MAK} model, and is not significantly harder to write down or apply. When the effects of fluctuations are negligible, the {MFK} description typically reduces to {MAK.} The {MFK} equations are capable of describing the average behavior of the network substantially better than {MAK}, because they incorporate the effects of fluctuations on the evolution of the means. They also account for the effects of the means on the evolution of the variances and covariances, to produce quite accurate uncertainty bands around the average behavior. The {MFK} computations, although approximate, are significantly faster than Monte Carlo methods for computing first and second moments in systems of chemical reactions. They may therefore be used, perhaps along with a few Monte Carlo simulations of sample state trajectories, to efficiently provide a detailed picture of the behavior of a chemical system.},

Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm ({SSA)} and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale {SSA.}},

Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins—and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes {mRNA} an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80\% of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 106 molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by {mRNA} levels or codon bias measurements.},

Furthermore, bypassing model simulations may lead to significant time savings in complex models, for instance those found in population genetics.
