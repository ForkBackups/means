Number of reactions:
<number of reactions>

Number of rate constants:
<number of rate constants>

Number of variables (species):
<number of variables>

Stoichiometry matrix (should be nvariables*nreactions):
<[enter,each,row]>
<[of,stoichiometry,matrix]>
<[as,a,list]>

Reaction propensities (in terms of rate parameters c[i] and variables y[j]): 
<one reaction per line>
<i.e.:>
<c[0]*y[0]*(y[0]-1)>
<c[1]*y[1] ... etc.>
<use float where appropriate i.e. 1/2 should be float(1)/2>
