MEANS Tutorial
===========================

This tutorial is designed to provide a quick introduction to the MEANS package.

We split the tutorial into four parts:

1. [**Modelling Using MEANS**](tutorial/1. Modelling Using MEANS.ipynb) -- a general introduction to MEANS -- along with [**an example how to parse SBML files**](tutorial/1a. SBML Parsing Example.ipynb)
2. [**Simulation.ipynb**](tutorial/2. Simulation.ipynb) -- introduction on simulation of biological systems using MEANS
3. [**Parameter Inference**](tutorial/3. Parameter Inference.ipynb) -- tutorial on parameter inference in MEANS
4. [**Input & Output**](tutorial/4. Input & Output.ipynb) -- a set of examples of how data can be imported to or exported from MEANS models.

Whilst all examples are available online, we invite the user to interact with them using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).
Jupyter is an interactive interface to python that is easy to install using pip:

    pip install jupyter

Alternatively, follow the [instructions on Jupyter homepage](https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).

Once Jupyter is installed feel download the source code of `MEANS`, 
either by clicking *Download ZIP* [here](https://github.com/theosysbio/means) or [cloning the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/),
and start the Jupyter notebook in the tutorials directory:

    cd tutorials
    jupyter notebook

A new browser window will open with the list of tutorials that you can then follow interactively.
Consult the [package readme file](README.md) for troubleshooting any issues that may occur.
