MEANS
===================================================================================

MEANS is python package for Moment Expansion Approximation, iNference and Simulation.

We present a free, user-friendly tool implementing an efficient `moment expansion approximation with parametric closures`_

 that integrates well with the IPython interactive environment. Our package enables the analysis of complex stochastic systems without any constraints on the number of species and moments studied and the type of rate laws in the system. In addition to the approximation method our package provides numerous tools to help non-expert users in stochastic analysis.
